# badoverloader
it's just spamming apps. i'm not responsible for anything you will do to your or friend computer.

To prank friends you need to create shortcut for the overloader (Steam.bat) and then install or find the icon for steam if you can't prank your friend just download
an virtualbox and try it yourself (You better use virtualbox. Not using the virtualbox can result in pc crash)
